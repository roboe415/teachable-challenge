My first steps were to identify all of the design elements and containers, then ideate on how the current screen can be improved and redesigned.

I felt there should be more emphasis on the Attendees list so I reduced the amount of visual containers to one, combining the submission form and empty list.

I then felt the original screen was lacking visual hierarchy so I increased the font-size of the event title for clarity and aesthetic purposes. I also added a back icon, allowing the organizer to view more events.

To me the second most important element was the form, keeping it above the list at all times and possibly fixed in position. If the attendees list begins to feel too long it may need to scroll inside it’s own container.

I then introduced a more minimal design to the form fields, only using a bottom border for white space and cleanliness. At first, the form fields only show placeholders until you activate the field by entering text. Active and entered fields then introduce field labels in slightly smaller and dulled text.

I changed the submit button text to “Add” since we’re adding to a list here and not sending a message or requiring confirmation. I also used large rounded corners and a bright blue color for visual clarity on how to use this app.

Personally I practice a minimal design aesthetic, preferably using whites and greys with 1-2 bright colors for CTAs and buttons.

I also removed the dotted border from the empty attendees container. I feel more users are now assume that dotted lines are for drag and drop functionality.

After the organizer adds an attendee, you then see the information populate in a list below. My goal here was to show the move icon at all times, hiding the edit and delete icons only to show if you hover over an attendee’s row. I also included photos of the attendee that would be attached to email address if validated, adding a touch of personality and also helps with recognition at the actual event. 

If a organizer wishes to edit an attendee’s information they simply must click on the pencil icon to activate the editable form fields, bringing them into focus.

I also added a share icon that displays once you add attendees. The idea here was to allow the organizer to share, email or print the list without showing editing elements. 

I spent nearly 3 hours on challenge, which hopefully gives you an idea of my design capabilities. I believe in a share early, share often motto and if this was a real project, I’d ideally like to follow a lean UX design process. Mainly consisting of the following steps:

- Learning from real users and understanding available data, helping to define the problem
- Ideating and sketching multiple solutions
- Testing solutions with real users to identify if iterations are needed
- Prototyping high-fidelity designs that ultimately validate the solution
